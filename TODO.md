# Todo list
finished 1. create some new files (more than 5), with functions and classes, with preprocessor flags.	
finished 2. try to compile them manually, in terminal.
finished 3. make multiple versions of makefiles, from simple to complex
4. makefile-1: everything copy from the terminal
5. makefile-2: replace some of the parameters with variables
6. makefile-3: compile dynamic and static library, using some of the functions
7. makefile-4: make the library in makefike-3 to other path, and then link them to the main (No any mannual copy or move)
8. Now you can switch to CMake
